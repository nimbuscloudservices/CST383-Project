# Traffic Stop Victim Prediction
## Introduction

According to data from the Stanford Open Policing Project, law enforcement officers in the United States perform around 50,000 traffic stops every day. The project has collected traffic stop data from 40 different states, including the city of San Francisco in California, which is the focus of our project. Previous research has found that racial profiling and bias may play a role in who gets pulled over. Therefore, our project aims to predict the race of individuals who are stopped for traffic violations based on the reason for the stop and whether or not they receive a citation.
