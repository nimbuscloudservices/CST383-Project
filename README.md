# Traffic Stop Victim Prediction
## Introduction

According to data from the Stanford Open Policing Project, law enforcement officers in the United States perform around 50,000 traffic stops every day. The project has collected traffic stop data from 40 different states, including the city of San Francisco,  CA, which is the focus of our project. 

Previous research has found that racial profiling and bias may play a role in who gets pulled over. Our project aims to predict the race of individuals who were stopped for traffic violations based on the reason for the stop and whether or not they receive a citation.

## Selection of Data

Data Sources: 
San Francisco Data Set (zip file): <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:yg821jf8611/yg821jf8611_ca_san_francisco_2020_04_01.csv.zip"> here </a>

Due to the breath of data provided in the Stanford Open Policing Project, our group decided to focus on San Francisco as the location for testing and training our model. The San Francisco Police Traffic Stop data contains 905,070 entries from 2008 to 2014 and includes 21 features. As part of our data pre-processing, we dropped all entries containing N/A values along with columns that were not relevant to our project.

After pre-processing, we have 8 columns. Five of our features are booleans and 3 are an object data type.

Features by Examples:

- **subject_race**: 'asian/pacific islander', 'black','hispanic', 'white', 'other'
- **subject_sex**: 'female', 'male'
- **arrest_made**: True, False
- **citation_issued (predictor variable)**: True, False
- **warning_issued**: True, False
- **outcome (predictor variable)**: 'warning', 'citation', 'arrest'
- **search_conducted**: True, False
- **search_vehicle**: True, False

Additionally we had to encode subject_race as it was catergorical data which would not work unless encoded.  

**Target**: [subject_race]

**Predictors**: [outcome, subject_sex]

## Methods
**Toos**:
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization
- Scikit-learn for inference
**Inference Methods used with Scikit**:
- Models: kNN Classification, Forward Selection, Decision Tree Classification, Non-Linear SVC Classification
- Features: StandardScaler, LabelEncoder

## Results

**Traffic Data**

First we will explore variables in from the data. On the left plot, we have a bar plot that displays the amount of citations vs warnings given. On the middle plot, we have traffic stops by sex of the individual stopped. And on the right plot, we see that police officers performed traffic stops on male subjects more than females.

**Traffic Data by Race**

The bar plot on the left provides context to the outcome of getting your vehicle searched based on race. Police officers performed more vehicle searches on Black individuals when compared to other races.

The plot on the right provides context to the outcome of the traffic stop based on race. According to the bar plot, police officers are arresting Black individuals more than other races.

**Traffic Data by Age**

The dataset has a high density of subjects ranging from 20-30 years old. We used a violin plot to represent the age of people stopped, distributed by race.
